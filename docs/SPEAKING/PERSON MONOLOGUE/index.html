<p>The person I’d like to talk about is my uncle, Mr. Quang, who is known for always having strong opinions. He is a retired professor of <strong>sociology</strong>, and I’ve known him since I was a child because we often visited him during family gatherings.</p>
<p>My uncle, who used to lecture at a <strong>prestigious</strong> university, is highly knowledgeable and well-<strong>read</strong>. I believe he’s an opinionated person because he is deeply passionate about topics like education and social justice. For <strong>example</strong>, he often debates with my father about how education policies should be reformed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, his strong opinions can be overwhelming, but I really admire his conviction and <strong>confidence</strong>. He has taught me the importance of standing up for my beliefs and always thinking critically.</p>

<li><strong>Who he/she is</strong>The person I’d like to describe is my best friend, Lan, who has an insatiable love for reading. She works as a librarian, which fits her passion perfectly. I’ve known her since high school when we bonded over our shared love for literature.</li>
<li><strong>How you knew he/she</strong>We first met in the school library during a book club meeting. I remember being impressed by how insightful her opinions were about the book we were discussing. Over the years, our friendship grew as we often exchanged books and talked about them for hours.</li>
<li><strong>What does he/she read</strong>Lan reads a variety of genres, but she particularly enjoys historical fiction and self-help books. Recently, she has been exploring classic literature and told me she found &quot;War and Peace&quot; incredibly thought-provoking. She also enjoys reading blogs and articles about personal growth in her spare time.</li>
<li><strong>Why you think he/she likes to read a lot</strong>I believe she enjoys reading because it allows her to explore new worlds and perspectives. She once told me that books are her escape from the stress of daily life. Additionally, her curious nature drives her to constantly learn new things through reading.</li>

<li><strong>Who he/she is</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An old friend I reconnected with recently is Minh, who was my best friend during middle school. We were inseparable back then, always hanging out after school. Minh is now a software engineer living in another city.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How you knew each other</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We met in sixth grade when we were both assigned to the same class. We quickly became friends because we shared a passion for playing badminton and solving puzzles. I still remember how we used to compete to see who could finish a Rubik&#x27;s cube faster.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why you lost contact</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, we lost touch when his family moved to another city after middle school. At that time, social media wasn’t as common, so it was hard to stay connected.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How you got in contact again</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A few months ago, I stumbled upon his profile on Facebook and decided to send him a message. We caught up over a video call, reminiscing about our childhood and updating each other about our lives.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How you felt after getting in contact again</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I felt a deep sense of nostalgia and joy after reconnecting with Minh. It was heartwarming to realize that despite the years apart, our bond remained strong. We’ve promised to meet in person soon and stay in touch more regularly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Who this person is</strong>The person I’d like to describe is my aunt, who is incredibly talented at crafting handmade jewelry. She lives in a small town and has been making things by hand for over a decade.</li>
<li><strong>What he/she makes</strong>She creates beautiful necklaces, bracelets, and earrings using beads, natural stones, and even recycled materials. Her most impressive creation was a pair of earrings made entirely from seashells she collected on a beach trip.</li>
<li><strong>How do you feel</strong>I feel inspired by her creativity and patience. Watching her work is almost therapeutic because she puts so much attention into every detail. Her dedication has taught me to appreciate the value of handmade items.</li>
<li><strong>Why that person is good at making things by hand</strong>I think she’s skilled because she has a natural eye for design and years of experience. She once told me that crafting is not just a hobby for her; it’s a way to express her personality and emotions. Her ability to turn simple materials into beautiful art is truly admirable.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Describe a person who other people often ask for advice</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who this person is</strong>The person I’d like to describe is my high school teacher, Mr. Hung, who was known for his wise advice. He was not only an excellent English teacher but also a great mentor to many students, including me.</li>
<li><strong>Why you asked for the advice</strong>I once asked him for advice about choosing a major for university. I was unsure whether to pursue business or education, and he patiently listened to my concerns. He then guided me to think about my long-term goals and interests.</li>
<li><strong>What the advice was</strong>He suggested I consider what I was most passionate about and envision where I saw myself in 10 years. His advice helped me realize that I wanted a career where I could interact with people, which eventually led me to choose education.</li>
<li><strong>How you felt about the advice</strong>His guidance was incredibly insightful and reassuring. I felt more confident in my decision and grateful for his support. To this day, I look back on that conversation as a turning point in my life.</li>

<li><strong>Who the person is</strong>The person I’d like to describe is my cousin, Mai, who is a dedicated nurse. She has been working at a pediatric hospital in Ho Chi Minh City for the past five years.</li>
<li><strong>What profession they chose</strong>Mai chose to become a pediatric nurse because she loves working with children and wants to make a positive impact on their lives. She often tells me about her rewarding yet challenging experiences at work.</li>
<li><strong>Why they decided to work in this field</strong>She was inspired to pursue this career after volunteering at a hospital during college. She saw how much difference a caring nurse could make in a patient’s recovery and decided to dedicate her life to this noble profession.</li>
<li><strong>How you feel about their choice</strong>I deeply admire her choice. It’s a demanding job, but her compassion and resilience are remarkable. Her dedication to helping others motivates me to be more empathetic and hardworking in my own life.</li>

<li><strong>Who this person is</strong>The person I’d like to talk about is my grandfather, Mr. Binh, who is now 85 years old. He lives in a small village in the north of Vietnam and has always been a great storyteller.</li>
<li><strong>Where he/she lives</strong>My grandfather has lived in the same village all his life, in a cozy house surrounded by rice fields. The peaceful environment reflects his calm and wise personality.</li>
<li><strong>What he/she has done in his/her life</strong>He has lived an extraordinary life, working as a teacher in remote areas and helping underprivileged children receive an education. Later, he became a village leader and successfully advocated for clean water and better roads in his community.</li>
<li><strong>How you feel about this person</strong>I feel immense pride and admiration for my grandfather. His dedication to improving the lives of others has been a constant source of inspiration for me. I hope to embody his values of kindness and perseverance in my own life.</li>
