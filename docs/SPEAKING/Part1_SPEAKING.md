## HOW HAS X CHANGED?

Has the music that you listen to changed since you were young?

How has your mobile phone changed your life?

What changes has the development of technology brought about in our lives?

Have relationships between parents and children changed in recent years? Why do you  think that is?

### **1. Has the music that you listen to changed since you were young?**  
A1: Yes, it has. When I was younger, I mostly listened to pop songs that were popular among teenagers. Now, I’ve started to enjoy a wider range of music, including jazz and classical music. I think this change happened because I’ve matured and developed a deeper appreciation for more sophisticated genres.

A2: Yes, it has. When I was younger, I mainly listened to pop songs that were simple and catchy. But as I grew older, my taste changed, and now I prefer listening to classical music and jazz because they feel more relaxing and meaningful. The availability of streaming platforms has also made it easier to explore different genres.

### **2. How has your mobile phone changed your life?**  
A1: My mobile phone has completely transformed my life. In the past, I used to rely on landlines and letters to communicate, which were slow and inconvenient. Now, with my smartphone, I can instantly connect with people, access information, and even work remotely. It has made my life much more efficient and convenient.

A2: My mobile phone has completely transformed how I stay connected with others. It’s not just for calling or texting anymore—I use it to manage my schedule, study online, and even shop. It has made life more convenient, but sometimes I feel it’s also a distraction when I spend too much time on social media.

### **3. What changes has the development of technology brought about in our lives?**  
The development of technology has brought immense changes. In the past, tasks like shopping and banking were time-consuming and required physical presence. Now, we can do these things online from the comfort of our homes. Additionally, technology has revolutionized education and healthcare, making both more accessible.

### **4. Have relationships between parents and children changed in recent years? Why do you think that is?**  
Yes, they have. In the past, parents and children often had more face-to-face interactions because technology was limited. Now, with the rise of smartphones and social media, many families spend less quality time together. I think this is because technology is both a distraction and a means of communication, which has altered how relationships function.

## WHAT DO YOU WANT/HOPE TO DO (IN THE FUTURE?)

Will you use public transport more in the future? (Why/ Why not?)

Do you want to travel to outer space in the future?

What is the biggest challenge in your future?

### **1. Will you use public transport more in the future? (Why/Why not?)**  
Yes, I hope to use public transport more in the future. It’s an eco-friendly way to travel, and with improved infrastructure like electric buses and trains, it’s becoming more convenient. I’d like to contribute to reducing my carbon footprint.

### **2. Do you want to travel to outer space in the future?**  
No, I don’t. While it sounds exciting, I’m not particularly interested in leaving Earth. I think exploring our planet and its diverse cultures is more fulfilling for me than venturing into space.

**3. What is the biggest challenge in your future?**  
I think the biggest challenge in my future will be maintaining a healthy work-life balance. With increasing responsibilities, it will be difficult to manage my career and personal life effectively without feeling overwhelmed.

## HOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE X?

What can be improved in public transport services?

How would you improve your apartment/house?

How would you improve your school to make it better?

How can children improve their social skills?

### **1. What can be improved in public transport services?**

Public transport is often overcrowded during peak hours, and some buses are not very clean or comfortable. I suggest the authorities improve it by adding more buses and trains during rush hours to reduce overcrowding. They could also make the seats more comfortable and upgrade the ticketing system to digital options.  
These changes would make public transport faster, cleaner, and much more convenient for everyone.

### **2. How would you improve your apartment/house?**

My apartment feels a bit cramped and doesn’t get much sunlight. I would make it better by decluttering and getting rid of unnecessary furniture. I’d also have larger windows installed to bring in more light and repaint the walls with bright colors.  
This would make the space feel bigger, brighter, and much more comfortable.

---

### **3. How would you improve your school to make it better?**

The classrooms in my school feel outdated, and the library doesn’t have enough books or resources. I suggest upgrading the classrooms with smart boards and modern desks. I’d also add more books and e-resources to the library.  
These changes would make studying more interesting and help students learn better.

---

### **4. How can children improve their social skills?**

Many kids spend too much time on phones or tablets and don’t talk to others much. To improve, they could join team sports or drama clubs to learn teamwork and communication. Parents should also encourage them to spend more time with friends and family.  
This would help them become more confident and better at connecting with others.

## HOW IMPORTANT IS X?

Do you think it’s a good thing if you always make others laugh?

Do you think students need more relaxing time?

Do you think there is too much sport on television in your country?

### **1. Do you think it’s a good thing if you always make others laugh?**  
I think it’s moderately important to make others laugh. Humor can help build strong relationships and ease tense situations, but it’s also important to balance it with seriousness when needed.

### **2. Do you think students need more relaxing time?**  
Yes, I think it’s very important for students to have more relaxing time. It helps them recharge and reduces stress, which ultimately improves their focus and productivity in academics.

### **3. Do you think there is too much sport on television in your country?**  
No, I don’t think so. Sports broadcasts are a great way for people to stay connected with their favorite teams and players. They also promote physical activity and inspire younger generations to stay active. However, there should still be a balance with other types of content like documentaries or cultural shows.
