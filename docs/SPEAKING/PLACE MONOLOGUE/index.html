<p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to describe a cultural place that I’ve always wanted to visit – the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology in Hanoi. It’s a renowned museum that focuses on the 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam, showcasing their traditions, lifestyles, and unique cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Where it is:</strong> The museum is located in the heart of Hanoi, not far from the city center, which makes it quite convenient for both locals and tourists to visit. It’s surrounded by a peaceful garden, adding to its charm.</p>
<p><strong>How you knew this place:</strong> I first heard about the museum during a school trip discussion when my teacher mentioned it as an ideal place to learn about Vietnam’s cultural diversity. Later, I looked it up online and was impressed by the pictures and reviews.</p>
<p><strong>What it is like:</strong> The museum has both indoor and outdoor sections. Inside, there are exhibits displaying traditional costumes, tools, and artefacts used by ethnic minorities. Outside, there’s a collection of reconstructed houses representing different architectural styles, like the stilt houses of the Thai people and the longhouses of the Ede community. It feels like stepping into the lives of these ethnic groups.</p>
<p><strong>How the place is related to culture:</strong> This museum is deeply connected to culture because it preserves and celebrates the heritage of all ethnic groups in Vietnam. By visiting, you can learn how each group contributes to the country’s identity, from their festivals to their crafts and daily activities.</p>
<p>Visiting the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology would be an eye-opening experience for me. It would help me not only learn about my own country’s diversity but also gain a deeper respect for the cultural traditions that make Vietnam so special.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to talk about a place where people can see a lot of wildlife – <strong>Cuc Phuong National Park</strong>, the oldest national park in Vietnam. It’s located in Ninh Binh province, about 120 kilometers from Hanoi, and is famous for its rich biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Where it is:</strong> The park is surrounded by limestone mountains and lush green forests, creating a tranquil and picturesque environment. It’s easily accessible by car or motorbike, which is why it attracts many visitors every year.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of wildlife people can see there:</strong> Cuc Phuong is home to a wide range of wildlife. Visitors can spot langurs, civets, and various types of deer. The park is also a paradise for birdwatchers, with hundreds of bird species, including the rare Delacour&#x27;s langur. If you visit during butterfly season, you’ll see thousands of colorful butterflies flying everywhere – a breathtaking sight.</p>
<p><strong>Whether people like to go there:</strong> Many people love visiting Cuc Phuong because it’s not just about seeing animals. There are guided tours, hiking trails, and even a Primate Rescue Center where you can learn about conservation efforts to protect endangered species.</p>
<p><strong>How you feel about it:</strong> Personally, I feel that Cuc Phuong is an incredible place to connect with nature. Walking through the forest, listening to the sounds of birds and insects, and seeing these majestic creatures up close is truly unforgettable. It also reminds us of the importance of preserving such natural treasures for future generations.</p>

<p><strong>Model Answer 1</strong></p>
<p>One public park that I often go to is <strong>Công viên Lê Thị Riêng</strong> in Ho Chi Minh City. It’s a vibrant and well-maintained park, offering a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p><strong>When you often go there:</strong> I usually visit the park early in the morning or in the late afternoon when the weather is cooler. It’s the perfect time for exercise or simply unwinding after a long day.</p>
<p><strong>Where it is:</strong> The park is located in District 10, which is quite central. It’s surrounded by cafes, street food vendors, and residential areas, making it accessible and convenient for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Who you often go there with:</strong> I often go there with my family, especially my younger siblings. Sometimes, I also join my friends for a jog or a picnic.</p>
<p><strong>And explain how you feel about it:</strong> I feel very relaxed and re-energized whenever I visit the park. The greenery, the fresh air, and the sound of birds chirping create a serene environment that helps me clear my mind. It’s also a great place for bonding with loved ones.</p>
<p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to talk about <strong>Thong Nhat Park</strong>, also known as Reunification Park, which is one of the largest green spaces in Hanoi. It’s a perfect place for people to relax and enjoy nature amidst the busy city.</p>
<p><strong>When you often go there:</strong></p>
<p>I usually visit this park in the mornings or evenings during weekends. It’s my favorite spot to exercise, breathe in some fresh air, and escape from the noise of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Where it is:</strong></p>
<p>The park is located in the Hai Ba Trung district, near the city center, and is easily accessible by motorbike or even public transport. It’s surrounded by tall trees and has a large lake in the middle, which adds to its serene atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Who you often go there with:</strong></p>
<p>I typically go there with my friends or family. Sometimes, I join my neighbors for group exercise sessions, like aerobics or jogging. Occasionally, I also take my little nephew to play in the children’s playground area.</p>
<p><strong>And explain how you feel about it:</strong></p>
<p>Thong Nhat Park gives me a sense of tranquility and relaxation. The greenery, the sound of birds chirping, and the sight of people engaging in outdoor activities make me feel connected to nature. I particularly enjoy walking along the lake while chatting with friends. It’s also a place where I can slow down and reflect, which is something I deeply value in such a fast-paced city like Hanoi.</p>

<p><strong>Model Answer 1.</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to tell you about <strong>Bến Thành Market</strong>, one of the busiest places in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p><strong>When you went there:</strong> I went there last summer when my cousin from Hanoi came to visit. We wanted to explore some iconic spots in the city.</p>
<p><strong>Who you went there with:</strong> I went with my cousin and a couple of friends who acted as tour guides since they know the market quite well.</p>
<p><strong>Why you went there:</strong> We went there to shop for souvenirs and try some local street food. The market is famous for its variety of products, from clothes to handcrafted items, and, of course, delicious Vietnamese snacks.</p>
<p><strong>And explain how you felt about it:</strong> Honestly, I felt a mix of excitement and exhaustion. The vibrant atmosphere, with people haggling and vendors shouting, was thrilling, but the crowd was overwhelming at times. Still, the experience was worth it, and I’d love to go back.</p>
<p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p>
<p>Let me tell you about a crowded place I visited recently – <strong>Dong Xuan Market</strong>, a bustling indoor market in Hanoi. It’s one of the oldest and busiest markets in the city, attracting both locals and tourists.</p>
<p><strong>When you went there:</strong></p>
<p>I went there about two months ago, during the Tet holiday season. It was an exciting but incredibly hectic time because everyone was shopping for decorations, food, and gifts.</p>
<p><strong>Who you went there with:</strong></p>
<p>I went with my mom because she needed help carrying the items she planned to buy. It was a bit of a family tradition for us to go shopping together before the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p><strong>Why you went there:</strong></p>
<p>We went there to buy traditional decorations like red envelopes, lucky charms, and some fresh flowers to brighten up our home. It’s also a great place to buy local snacks and spices for holiday cooking.</p>
<p><strong>And explain how you felt about it:</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, I had mixed feelings about the experience. On the one hand, the lively atmosphere was infectious, and it was fascinating to see so many people from different walks of life gathered in one place. On the other hand, it was overwhelming at times because of the noise, the narrow aisles, and the constant jostling. Still, I’d say it was worth it because it’s a unique experience that truly captures the energy and spirit of Tet in Vietnam.</p>

<p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to describe a room I visited in my best friend’s house, which is her <strong>living room</strong>. It’s where her family usually gathers and spends time together.</p>
<p><strong>Whose room it is:</strong></p>
<p>The room belongs to my friend, Linh. She shares the house with her parents and siblings, and the living room is the heart of their home.</p>
<p><strong>When you went there:</strong></p>
<p>I first went to her house about a year ago when she invited me over for her birthday party. It was a small celebration with close friends, and we spent most of the time in her living room.</p>
<p><strong>How you felt about it:</strong></p>
<p>I felt really comfortable and welcomed. The room had a cozy vibe, with warm yellow lighting, a soft carpet, and a big comfortable sofa. There were also family photos on the walls and shelves filled with books and decorative items, which made the space feel very personal and homely.</p>
<p><strong>And explain why you have been to that person’s room:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been to that room many times since because it’s where we usually hang out when I visit her. We watch movies together, have snacks, or simply chat for hours. I really love how inviting and relaxing her living room is.</p>

<p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
<p>My ideal home would be a <strong>modern house</strong> located in a peaceful area surrounded by nature.</p>
<p><strong>Where it would be:</strong></p>
<p>It would be in the suburbs, not too far from the city but far enough to escape the noise and pollution. I’d love it to be near a lake or a forest, so I could enjoy the beauty of nature every day.</p>
<p><strong>What it would look like:</strong></p>
<p>The house would have a minimalist design with large glass windows, letting in plenty of natural light. It would have two floors: the ground floor for shared spaces like the living room and kitchen, and the upper floor for bedrooms and a study.</p>
<p><strong>What special features it would have:</strong></p>
<p>I’d like a spacious garden where I could grow flowers and vegetables, as well as a small patio for outdoor dining. Another dream feature would be a library room with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Finally, a smart home system to control lighting and security would be a must for convenience.</p>
<p><strong>And explain why it would be an ideal place for you:</strong></p>
<p>This house would be ideal for me because it combines comfort, functionality, and the chance to connect with nature. I think it would be the perfect place to relax after a long day and enjoy a slower pace of life.</p>

<p><strong>Model Answer:</strong></p>
<p>One place in Ho Chi Minh City that I would love to take my parents and friends to is <strong>Ben Thanh Market</strong>, which is not only a bustling marketplace but also an iconic symbol of the city.</p>
<p><strong>What the place is:</strong></p>
<p>Ben Thanh Market is one of the oldest markets in Vietnam, and it’s famous for its wide variety of goods, from fresh produce and traditional handicrafts to souvenirs and street food. It’s a vibrant and lively spot that reflects the energy of Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p><strong>Where it is:</strong></p>
<p>The market is located in District 1, right in the city center. It’s easy to get to by taxi or even by walking if you’re nearby. The market is surrounded by famous landmarks, making it a convenient stop on any city tour.</p>
<p><strong>When you would like to visit there:</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to take my parents or friends there during the daytime so we can explore the stalls and try some delicious local dishes like pho, banh xeo, or fresh spring rolls. Visiting in the evening is also an option because the area transforms into a night market with a different vibe.</p>
<p><strong>And explain why you would like to take your parents or friends there:</strong></p>
<p>I think Ben Thanh Market is a great place to experience the culture and lifestyle of the city. My parents would enjoy shopping for high-quality Vietnamese products like silk or coffee, while my friends might be more interested in trying street food or taking Instagram-worthy photos. Personally, I love the lively atmosphere and the chance to share the unique energy of Ho Chi Minh City with others.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/nguyenhaiha269/my-website/tree/main/docs/SPEAKING/PLACE MONOLOGUE.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_JAkA"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/my-website/docs/SPEAKING/PERSON MONOLOGUE"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">PERSON MONOLOGUE</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/my-website/docs/SPEAKING/SPEAKING-SUMMARY"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">SPEAKING SUMMARY</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#3-describe-a-cultural-place-that-you-would-like-to-learn-the-culture-there-eg-a-library-museum-theatre" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight"><strong>3.
